# RANDOM-IMAGE-FETCHER
This is a simple program for fetching and downloading a random image of specified size from https://picsum.photos/. To those just looking for the EXE file, find it in the bin/release folder. To those wanting to debug, open Visual Studio 2022, select Open Project, and then choose the FetchRandomImage.sln file.

###### PS: I just made this to familiarize myself with Windows Forms .NET and C#
